// Ultimate Memory Trick
//
//Factory → Create Different Objects
//Strategy → Same Object, Different Behavior

//Factory pattern is a design pattern which helps to get the instance
// by passing the input to this static method.
//by doing this we can avoid the method create the loosely copuled
// classes for the client based on the input they have provided.
