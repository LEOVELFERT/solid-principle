SRP-single Responsiblity Principle
OCP-Open Closed Principle




SRP -Single Responsiblity Principle
-------------------------------------
A class should have the single responsiblity
lets say if we have the User class its purpose is to creating the user then it should not sending the notification.

right
User{
name;
email;

//getter setter
}

wrong
User{
email;
name;
sendEmail();
}


Open close Principle:
class should be opened and it should be closed.
